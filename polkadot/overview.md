# Polkadot Staking Overview

Staking in the Polkadot network using the Staking API can be done in several ways:

[**Public Node**]()

1. Submit Bond: Submit a bond to the Polkadot network in exchange for certain benefits.
2. Sign Transaction: Sign the transaction before broadcasting it.
3. Send Transaction: Broadcast the transaction to the Polkadot network.
4. Submit Nomination: The process of selecting validators within the Polkadot network.

[**Privat Node**]()

1. Submit Bond: Submit a bond to the Polkadot network in exchange for certain benefits.
2. Sign Transaction: Sign the transaction before broadcasting it.
3. Send Transaction: Broadcast the transaction to the Polkadot network.
4. Add Proxy Account: Staking proxies allow users to delegate their staking rights to another account, which can then sign transactions on their behalf.
