# Overview

Staking in the Solana network using the Staking API consists of several main steps:

1. Create stake transaction.
2. Sign unsigned transaction.
3. Send signed transaction.

[Get an authentication token](doc:authentication) to start using Staking API.

We provide two distinct endpoints for testing and production environments.

- PRODUCTION: <https://api.p2p.org>
- TESTING: <https://api-test.p2p.org>

For Solana available several networks:

- `mainnet-beta` — the production network.
- `testnet` — a testnet.
